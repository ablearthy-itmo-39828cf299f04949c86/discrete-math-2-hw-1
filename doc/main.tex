\maketitle

\problem The graph of Europe \(\EGraph = \Pair{V, E}\). Let \(\EGraphL\) be the
largest connected component of \(\EGraph\)

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item \Cref{fig:map_basic} represents \(\EGraph\) with \textbf{no} intersecting
edges
\item \(|V| = 49\), \(|E| = 92\)

In order to count degree of each node, we should go through all edges, and
increment degree of a vertex if the edge contains the vertex. %TODO: link to code
\begin{align*}
\delta(\EGraphL) &= 1 \\
\Delta(\EGraphL) &= 9
\end{align*}

Radius, diameter and center can be obtained by calculating eccentricity for
each vertex (using BFS)

\begin{align*}
\rad(\EGraphL) &= 5 \\
\diam(\EGraphL) &= 8 \\
\mycenter(\EGraphL) &= \{\texttt{RUS}, \texttt{BLR}, \texttt{LTU}, \texttt{POL}, \texttt{UKR}, \texttt{CZE}, \texttt{DEU}, \texttt{SVK}, \texttt{HUN}, \texttt{HRV}, \texttt{AUT}, \texttt{CHE}, \texttt{SVN}\}
\end{align*}

\texttt{Girth} equals 3 --- \(\{\texttt{CHE}, \texttt{AUT}, \texttt{LIE}\}\)

Vertex and edges connectivity are obtained from the following observation:
\texttt{DNK} is conneced only with \texttt{DEU}, therefore
\[\varkappa(\EGraphL) = \lambda(\EGraphL) = 1\]

\item \textbf{Minimum vertex coloring}. Due to \textit{four color theorem},
there're at most 4 colors needed. Let's explore is it possible to use less
colors? Let's try to use 3 colors. However, it's impossible to color countries
\texttt{HRV}, \texttt{SRB}, \texttt{BIH}, \texttt{MNE}. They're all connected
with each other, so three colors is not enough, therefore we have to use four
colors. I used SMT solver (Z3) to find function \(V \to \mathbb{N}\). Here's
\href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/753891b/auto/vertex_coloring.py}{the
script}. See \cref{fig:vertex_coloring_map}.

\item \textbf{Minimum edge coloring}. I used SMT solver (Z3). Here's
\href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/8bc76f0/auto/edge_coloring.py}{the
solver}.
\textit{9} colors is enough. Coloring is shown in \cref{fig:edge_coloring_map}.

\item \textbf{Find the maximum clique}. I wrote the script to find maximum
clique
\href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/1c391015b3b3a8822ac5e7c6f949004ca919e267/auto/find_clique.py}{\texttt{find\_clique.py}}

The maximum clique is of size 4.
\(\texttt{HRV}, \texttt{SRB}, \texttt{BIH}, \texttt{MNE}\)

\item \textbf{Find the maximum stable set}. \href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/79a6584/auto/stable_set.py}{The script}.
\[|S| = 19\]
Countries included in stable set are shown in \cref{fig:stable_set_map}.

\item \textbf{Find the maximum matching}.
\href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/1fae45a/auto/matching.py}{The
script}.
\[|M| = 20\]
Countries included in stable set are shown in \cref{fig:matching_map}.

\item \textbf{Find the minimum vertex cover}.
\href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/cb98748/auto/vertex_cover.py}{The
script}.
\[|R| = 25\]
Countries included in vertex cover are shown in \cref{fig:vertex_cover_map}.

\item \textbf{Find the minimum edge cover}.
\href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/90b7019/auto/edge_cover.py}{The
script}.
\[|F| = 24\]
Edges included in edge cover are shown in \cref{fig:edge_cover_map}.

\item \textbf{Find the shortest closed walk \(W\) that visits every vertex of
\(\EGraphL\)}.

The shorted closed walk is at least of length \(|V| = 44\).
Since there's only one way from \texttt{ESP} to \texttt{ESP}, then in the closed walk
we should visit \texttt{ESP} at least twice. The same goes for \texttt{DEU}.
Therefore, the walk length is at least 46.
In addition to it, we should visit \texttt{FRA} at least three times (that's because
the walk should contain \texttt{MCO} and \texttt{PRT}).
Therefore, the walk length is at least 48.
We should visit \texttt{ITA} at least three times too, because it's connected with \texttt{SMR} and \texttt{VAT}.
Therefore, the walk length is at least 50.
We should visit \texttt{RUS} at least twice, because it's a cut vertex.
Therefore, the walk length is at least 51.

Let's use \textit{\textrussian{метод пристального взгляда}}.
In fact, there's a closed walk of length 51. Therefore, \(|W| = 51\).

\texttt{PRT}--\texttt{ESP}--\texttt{FRA}--\texttt{LUX}--\texttt{BEL}--\texttt{NLD}--\texttt{DEU}--\texttt{DNK}--\texttt{DEU}--\texttt{CZE}--\texttt{POL}--\texttt{SVK}--\texttt{HUN}--\texttt{ROU}--\texttt{MDA}--\texttt{UKR}--\texttt{BLR}--\texttt{LTU}--\texttt{LVA}--\texttt{EST}--\texttt{RUS}--\texttt{NOR}--\texttt{SWE}--\texttt{FIN}--\texttt{RUS}--\texttt{GEO}--\texttt{ARM}--\texttt{TUR}--\texttt{BGR}--\texttt{MKD}--\texttt{GRC}--\texttt{ALB}--\texttt{MNE}--\texttt{ROK}--\texttt{SRB}--\texttt{BIH}--\texttt{HRV}--\texttt{SVN}--\texttt{AUT}--\texttt{LIE}--\texttt{CHE}--\texttt{ITA}--\texttt{SMR}--\texttt{ITA}--\texttt{VAT}--\texttt{ITA}--\texttt{FRA}--\texttt{MCO}--\texttt{FRA}--\texttt{AND}--\texttt{ESP}--\texttt{PRT}

Validness of the closed walk can be checked by \href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/2be1a5d/auto/validate_closed_walk.py}{the script}.
Raw data can be obtained from \href{https://github.com/ablearthy-itmo-39828cf299f04949c86/discrete-math-2-hw-1/blob/fc8406d/data/vertex_closed_walk.txt}{here}.
